# GitHub Actions Quickstart

This is [HW 2 Part I](https://cis-3500.github.io/docs/example/homeworks/homework-2/#part-i-github-actions-quickstart-github-actions-quickstart) of CIS 3500 at UPenn. It follows the guide [GitHub Actions Quickstart](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/quickstart) to learn GitHub Actions.

Feedback provided to the guide: The screenshot in Step 4 of 'creating your first workflow' is outdated. Even though it doesn't affect our understanding too much, it could be better if it were updated. In addition, guidance on how to create a directory is not clear for people who are not familiar with GitHub.
